# CS224D
CS 224D course was really wonderful. I wish I had access to all the video lectures and also Q/A during office hours. But, whatever was made public was also huge. A big thanks to Stanford (and CS 224D instructor and TAs) to make this public. 

I was finally able to complete the assignments for CS 224D. (Except assignment 3 2nd part for which I was not able to find the zip file.) Pushing the initial commit for now (may be in future would refine it).

I feel, while I got a basic understanding of DNN, but to really concretize the gates and other components which were designed using NN, I need to do a lot of hands on. 

Also TensorFlow has gone through quite some changes while the course was created. However, enough material is present on net to incorporate the changes needed. 

- The forward and backprop equations have been derived at: https://aknirala.github.io/CS224D/FowdBkws.html
- Assignment1 folder contains a pdf where for problem 4, cost function and it's derivation, as needed, has been calculated. It contains the images.
- I have not searched for optimal parameters, nor I have used dropout everywhere (I just needed to get to know what DNN in NLP were all about).
- A lot of code for assignment 2 is inspired/taken from: https://github.com/vijayvee/CS224d_Assignment_2_Solutions
